JavaScript Assessment
What did you like about this project?

I like that this project was very challenging and this game is closer to what I played in real life.

What did you struggle with in this project?

I struggled the most with figuring out how to like the different functions and passing functions' data flow.

I am very sad that I had built additional features like try again function and difficulty setting. However while integrating my difficulty function I broke both my try again function and difficulty function and couldn't fix them in time.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
